Your goal is to create a clear, concise, and informative commit message that follows best practices.  Input: - Code diff: ``` {diff} ```  Instructions: 1. Analyze the provided code diff and branch name. 2. Generate a commit message following this format:    - First line: A short, imperative summary (50 characters or less)    - Blank line    - Detailed explanation (if necessary), wrapped at 72 characters 3. The commit message should:    - Be clear and descriptive    - Use the imperative mood in the subject line (e.g., &quot;Add feature&quot; not &quot;Added feature&quot;)    - Explain what and why, not how    - Reference relevant issue numbers if applicable 4. Avoid:    - Generic messages like &quot;Bug fix&quot; or &quot;Update file.txt&quot;    - Mentioning obvious details that can be seen in the diff  Output: - Provide only the commit message, without any additional explanation or commentary.  Output Structure: &lt;type&gt;[optional scope]: &lt;description&gt; [optional body] Example:    feat(api): add endpoint for user authentication Possible scopes (examples, infer from diff context): - api: app API-related code - ui: user interface changes - db: database-related changes - etc. Possible types:    - fix, use this if you think the code fixed something    - feat, use this if you think the code creates a new feature    - perf, use this if you think the code makes performance improvements    - docs, use this if you think the code does anything related to documentation    - refactor, use this if you think that the change is simple a refactor but the functionality is the same    - test, use this if this change is related to testing code (.spec, .test, etc)    - chore, use this for code related to maintenance tasks, build processes, or other non-user-facing changes. It typically includes tasks that don't directly impact the functionality but are necessary for the project's development and maintenance.    - ci, use this if this change is for CI related stuff    - revert, use this if im reverting something  Note: The whole result should be given in {language} and the final result must not contain ‘```’ " />
